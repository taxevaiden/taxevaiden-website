<Layout title="about | taxevaiden's website" description="who is this guy">
    <MainDiv title="about">
        <p>hello, i'm aiden.</p>

        <p>
            usually what i like to do in my free time is play some simple games
            like <a href="https://tetr.io/">TETR.IO.</a> if i am EXTRA bored, i might
            as well just play terraria. great game btw you should get it :)
        </p>

        <p>
            i also make random stuff from time to time. some of those random
            stuff are projects that were supposed to be finished, but now
            they're not! i wonder why.. (i'm lazy)
        </p>
        <p>the main coding languages i use are:</p>

        <ul>
            {mainLanguages.map((mainLanguage) => <li>{mainLanguage}</li>)}
        </ul>
    </MainDiv>

    <MainDiv title="may i have source code please :shy:">
        <p>sure, go ahead i don't care</p>
        <p>
            you can use inspect element to get the source code for this website.
            you can also use this at <a href="https://oldevaiden.pages.dev"
                >oldevaiden.pages.dev</a
            >
        </p>
        <p>OR if you want the <i>full</i> source code, here you go:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="https://github.com/taxevaiden/taxevaiden-website"
                    >taxevaiden-website</a
                >
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://github.com/taxevaiden/taxevaiden-website-old"
                    >taxevaiden-website-old</a
                >
            </li>
        </ul>
    </MainDiv>
</Layout>
