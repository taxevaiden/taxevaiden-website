			<h1>about</h1>

			<p>hello, i'm aiden.</p>

			<p>usually what i like to do in my free time is play some simple games like <a href="https://tetr.io/">TETR.IO.</a> if i am EXTRA bored, i might as well just play terraria. great game btw you should get it :)</p>

			<p>i also make random stuff from time to time. some of those random stuff are projects that were supposed to be finished, but now they're not! i wonder why.. (i'm lazy)<br>
			the main coding languages i use are:</p>

			<ul>
				{mainLanguages.map((mainLanguage) => <li>{mainLanguage}</li>)}
			</ul>
