<Layout title="changelog | taxevaiden's website" description="what were the pointless changes again?">
		<ChangelogDiv>
			<p>here you'll know what "pointless changes" i've made to this website. yes, i know you can just view the repo but some people don't know that much about github. this is a uhh cooler way to know what i've done</p>
			<p>(i actually just needed an excuse to keep working on this site)</p>
			<p>oh, and btw, changes that are very subtle that you wouldn't care enough about are not listed here. view the github repo to know what pointless changes i made</p>
		</ChangelogDiv>
