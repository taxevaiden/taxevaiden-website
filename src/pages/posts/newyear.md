*Hey um quick note I finished this post on the day this was posted but I never commited this post to theh actual website, so uh here you go*

it's 2025 already! i know i'm like, 18 days late but i've been, uh, pretty busy working on other projects

i really just made this post to talk about what's happening right now, and what i've been doing

## what is happening?

so um, my attention span may start to heal now

### the tiktok ban

just today, tiktok has been banned in the US. i live in the US so i'm obviously effected and i'm crashing out bro

i remember my last scroll on there. it was acting normal. a few scrolls in, the number of likes and comments starts to not work anymore, with both of them displaying 0. slowly the profile pictures started to be replaced with the placeholder. i scroll more.

i can't scroll anymore.

i refresh the app and i get greeted with this message.

![tiktok ban message](../../images/postImages/newyear/ban-message.png)

i'm actually so sad bro as i was scrolling, old tiktoks i already liked, or just old ones (from like 2020) in general was on my for you page.

i also checked [tiktok.com](https://tiktok.com) and it was down too.

But uh that same day it was REVIVED somehow,,, our president saved it apparently so :shrug:

Anyway i just wanted to make this post to update you guys
