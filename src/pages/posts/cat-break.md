before you read this,, this is entirely about the catto boi community in general. if you just clicked on my website and aren't in the catto boi discord or whatever, shoo

also it'll be a little messy since it's like 5:30 am and i had barely any sleep

## why?

back when i first joined the catto boi community, i was only there to just see catto content. i usually only join servers to see leaks from my favorite games. after talking a little in the server, i actually felt i belonged. i *thought* i was somewhere i could have safely conversations with other people about my interests.

up until now i was wrong.

i feel like it's common that there's always something bad happening in the server. it is genuinely so devastating to see a place that i once thought was cool turn into a warzone. it's a never-ending cycle of drama and conflict that leaves everyone feeling drained.

i will be honest, i do like drama. i like talking about what's going on. but there's a point where it's too much.

also i just feel like in general that the community is just managed terribly. like there could be situations that are SIGNIFICANTLY downplayed, and people just move on like nothing happened and probably didn't care. while someone could've just posted a goofy pic and immediately get kicked because it broke the rules just slightly... this is not a welcoming place, this is a place where you will be easily kicked out because i said so.

talking about that never-ending drama, guess what i scrolled on just now? MORE DRAMA!!!!!

I'm not going to address what the drama is about, but all i'll say is:
- it's genuinely fucking concerning
- i don't know what to say or do
- it's changed my mind on the community
- some people are TERRIBLE people

it's genuinely so tiring atp

## conclusion

y'all need to get your fucking shit together.

i just wanted to spill my feelings out since i've been thinking about this for a while and i just didn't want to keep it in my head.

cya in a month or two.
