remember that long post i wrote about how much i hated windows and wanted to move away from it? yea that one. i think i have the next best thing.

## wait what happened

i'm not going into that much detail but,,

- a relative gave me their Mac Mini
- reset everything
- reinstalled macOS (it still had Big Sur,,, somehow)
- set everything up!

i forgot how nice it is to use macOS. i have a MacBook Pro lying around that's from the 2010's, and despite its age or how slow it runs macOS Catalina, it was still a pleasure to use. i just liked macOS in general.

and now that i get to use the newest version of macOS, macOS Sequioa, i'm even more excited to explore each bit of its features. i'm also especially excited because ermm almost everything i use is apple products,,, and having a windows machine wasn't the greatest experience.

(oh my fucking god i sound like an apple glazer please don't bully me :sob:)

## features

so uh,, i'll just talk about features that i find really cool, or just something in general that is also cool

### iMessage

the messaging app used in every apple product. since i use it a lot to contact people i know,, it was annoying to know that iMessage wasn't on windows. i guess you could say it sort of is (windows supports having an iPhone connected to your pc or something idk) but it was kinda,,,, terrible

how convenient that i get to use iMessage all on here now!

### iPhone Mirroring

the feature that allows you to mirror your iPhone screen to your Mac, and control your iPhone. this is especially useful when your phone is in another room or something and you're too lazy to walk over to it.

i probably won't use it that much, but it's nice knowing i can always use this when i'm too lazy for reach for my phone. recieving notifications from my phone on my mac is pretty cool too.

### specs

i forgot if i already wrote about this,, but before i got a new PC, i had a windows laptop that i used for a while. nowadays i just do random stuff to it (like turn it into a steam deck) but back when i used it,, it was so bad sometimes. i already mentioned this earlier, but when i ran TETR.IO the fans were running at full speed and the laptop was so close to burning my lap sometimes.

however, it did have 1TB of storage. when i switched to the new PC, it had 512GB.

managing storage was now a pain in the ass.

luckily for me this mac has like, 1TB of storage. i'll just type out the specs because i can't keep typing for so long

- 1TB of storage
- 16GB of RAM
- M1 Processor

speaking of the M1 processor..

### how fast electron apps run

i'm gonna keep this section short, but running electron, even on the windows PC, was terrible.

i know electron apps are always like this, but after running on the mac, i was so surprised....

the M1 chip saved me from going insane ngl

## what now

i have now installed apps that were macOS only, such as Zed, that code editor. i'm using it to write this post rn. i also installed Arc, just to give it a try on macOS. turned out it was really nice and now i'm keeping it.

i may install more tools that help organize things but uh idk yet

ok bye
