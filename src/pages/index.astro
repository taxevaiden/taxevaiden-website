    <MainDiv title="hello!">
        <p>
            welcome to my web. usually i just post to my blog or put pointless
            new stuff on this website.
        </p>
        <p>why did i make this?</p>

        <ul>
            <li>I wanted to</li>
            <li>I'm somewhat good at coding</li>
            <li>I don't know</li>
        </ul>

        <h1 id="important-notes">IMPORTANT NOTES!!!</h1>

        <ul>
            <li>
                this website was made with a 1920x1080 screen using arc
                (chromium) as the browser
            </li>
            <li>
                enable javascript. it's not required, but if you want things
                like changing things i recommend you enable javascript
            </li>
            <li>
                you should try refreshing without cache often <b
                    >(ctrl+shift+r)</b
                > to see the "pointless new stuff" on this website.
            </li>
            <li>
                this website is not mobile friendly. at all. it's not designed
                for it yet and i plan to work on other things other than mobile
                support for this website. you can probably just use a tablet for
                now.
            </li>
            <li>
                adding onto that, this website is intended to be viewed on
                windows.
            </li>
        </ul>
