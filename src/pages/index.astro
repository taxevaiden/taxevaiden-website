			<p>Q: what did you use to make this website?<br>
			A: i used cloudflare pages to host, astro to make the website, vscode to code the website, and procreate for the cool arts (i feel like i'm missing out for not using ibisPaint X,,)</p>

			<p>Q: what happened to the old website?<br>
			A: the old website's code was terrible. i hated managing it. ok that's all
			
			<p>Q: why couldn't you host stuff like this on neocities or nekoweb?<br>
			A: cloudflare gave me a lot more control, i can do ANything</p>
			
			<p>Q: why doesn't this website have stuff that the old one had yet?<br>
			A: this website is still a WIP. i'm still working on stuff!!</p>

			<p>Q: are you ever adding comments?<br>
			A: maybe, maybe not. the service i used for comments was uhh,, weird i guess. it was good but oh my god i HATED THAT WATERMARK.... i had to pay to get rid of that i'm POOR</p>
